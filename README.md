*Additional Skills

###Calculator
I created a basic 4 function calculator able to add, subtract, multiply and divide. The calculator is complete with CSS styling and full javascript functionality.

###Pizza Menu
The pizza menu project created an interactive ordering platform for a basic pizza menu. The user is able to select the size and toppings of their pizza and submit their order. Once submitted, their order will be displayed on the page with the calculated price. The console will also display a summary of the order, including text explaining the first topping is included free of charge, and can be used as a receipt.

###Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is an interactive version of a classic tic-tac-toe game played against the computer. The game is complete with sounds and customized "X" and "O" tokens to play with, and resets to play again once either the user or the computer wins.

###Additional Skills
There were a number of skills utilized within the JavaScript course that were not included in the 3 main projects, but were taught to be able to utilize later on.
Things that were touched on were utilizing jQuery, JSON, AJAX, creating countdowns, slideshows, strings, dictionaries, math operators, expressions, loops and arrays, ternary operators, etc. These tasks were used to create a strong base of JavaScript knowledge and skills for a new developer.
